                <h1>Welcome to my profile!</h1>
                <p>
                    Hi! I'm a GNU/Linux enthusiast, a minimalistic desing enjoyer, 
                    a <a href="https://rawtext.club">tilde-community</a> member, a novice chess player 
                    and a second course computer science student. I'm also looking for a junior DevOps
                    engineer job and I'm confident I'm suited for that now.
                </p> 
                <p>
                    <h3>What do you do?</h3>
                    I do lots of stuff. Currently I'm learning Kubernetes (kubeadm "flavor") and trying
                    to simulate real working environment. I'm trying to deploy my own app (this website)
                    to a <a href="https://github.com/Starmaster99/headintheclouds/tree/main/kubeadm/">self-built cluster</a>.
                <br>I also have some project ideas. I really want this static site to become a real "about me" blog
                    where I can share my news and thoughts with everyone else. I also want to redesign this page
                    and do something with that dull gray background.
                <br>As I mentioned earlier, I still have my own self-build homeserver and store my homeservices
                    <a href="https://github.com/Starmaster99/headintheclouds/tree/main/homeservices">here</a>.
                <br>I also have several other projects on my <a href="https://github.com/Starmaster99">
                    Github page</a>, most of them are Python learning playgrounds.
                <br><a href="https://github.com/Starmaster99/dotfiles">I use Arch btw.</a>
                </p>
