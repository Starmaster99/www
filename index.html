                <h1>Welcome to my profile!</h1>
                <p>
                    Hi! I'm a GNU/Linux enthusiast, a minimalistic desing enjoyer, 
                    a <a href="https://rawtext.club">tilde-community</a> member, a novice chess player 
                    and a first course computer science student. I spend vast majority
                    of my time in the web, here I learn, play, communicate and find new friends.
                <br>This profile is also heavily inspired by other tilde profiles. 
                </p> 
                <p>
                    <h3>What do you do?</h3>
                    I do lots of stuff. Currently I'm learning Docker and improving my bash scripting
                    skills to become a DevOps engineer. I have a fully working self-made home NAS 
                    (Debian 11, 1TB) made of an old computer. I have a selfhosted bittorrent client
                    (Deluge) for my legitimate Linux ISOs, a container manager (Yacht), a mediaserver
                    (Jellyfin) and a cloud storage (Nextcloud) while running all of them containerized.
                <br>I also have several other projects on my <a href="https://github.com/Starmaster99">
                    Github page</a>, most of them are Python learning playgrounds.
                <br><a href="https://github.com/Starmaster99/dotfiles">I use Arch btw.</a>
                </p>
