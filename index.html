                <p>
                    Hello! I am a GNU/Linux enthusiast, minimalistic design enjoyer, a
                    <a href="https://rawtext.club">tilde-community</a> member,
                    a novice chess player and a second course computer science student.
                    <p>I am currently looking for a <b>junior DevOps engineer</b> job. Contact me:
                    <a href="mailto:starforce882@gmail.com">starforce882 AT google.com</a></p>
                </p>

                <h3>What do you usually do?</h3>
                    I am currently learning Kubernetes (a tool for building Kubernetes clusters, kubeadm variation) 
                    and I already know how to deploy this website in
                    <a href="https://github.com/Starmaster99/headintheclouds/tree/main/kubeadm">self-built cluster</a>.
                    I also simulate continuous integration processes that occur during application development.
                <p>I also have some ideas for projects. I really want this static site to become
                    a true "about me" blog where I can share my news and thoughts with everyone else.
                    I also want to redesign this page and do something with that boring gray background.
                <br>
                As I mentioned before, I still have my own home server that I built myself,
                    and <a href="https://github.com/Starmaster99/headintheclouds/tree/main/homeservices">here</a> I keep
                    my home services.
                </p>
                <p>I also have several other projects on <a href="https://github.com/Starmaster99">my
                    Github page</a>, most of them are Python learning playgrounds.
                </p>
                <a href="https://github.com/Starmaster99/dotfiles">By the way, I'm using Arch.</a>
                </p>
                <p>
                    <h3>How can I contact you?</h3>
